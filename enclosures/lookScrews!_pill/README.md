Motivation for this design: Faceplate screws could look cool. - Judge yourself 
Its a work build on top of giants (@gobrrrme and @blackcoffee).
The main chassis has the propperties of a battletested enclosure called SimplePill by @blackcoffee and connected buttons are slightly reworked design  done by @gobrrrme. 
What distinguishes this design are the visible screws on top of the enclosure and a presspad. 
This design has a few requirements.
    4x 10mm M2.5 risers
    8x 10mm M2.5 screws
The buttons and pressPad HAVE to be printed out of TPU fillament. The Top and Bottom are best from PLA but PETG will work just as well. 
The pressPad has a slightly smaller cavity for a stubby nub of the waveshare hat. DO NOT PANIC!. Its done on purpouse to achieve a friction for the pad to hold on the nub.
