Motivation for this design: Faceplate screws could look cool. Judge for yourself!

It's work that's built on top of giants (@gobrrrme and @blackcoffee).

The main chassis has the properties of a battle-tested enclosure called SimplePill by @blackcoffee and connected buttons are a slightly reworked design done by @gobrrrme.

What distinguishes this design are the visible screws on top of the enclosure and a presspad. 

This design requires:
* 4x 10mm M2.5 risers
* 8x 10mm M2.5 screws

The buttons and presspad HAVE to be printed out of TPU filament. The Top and Bottom are best from PLA but PETG will work just as well. The presspad has a slightly smaller cavity for the stubby nub of the waveshare hat. DO NOT PANIC! It's done on purpose to create friction for the pad to hold on the nub.
